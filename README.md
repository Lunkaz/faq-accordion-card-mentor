## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

### Links

- Live Site URL: [GitHub Pages](https://lunkaz.github.io/faq-accordion-card-mentor/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The real challenge was the CSS. I remember finishing the project very quickly and it looked perfect, but I (don't know what I was thinking) used em for the images and when I changed the font size, everything got damaged and that's when the challenge really started.

I am satisfied with my final result, all my CSS fills me with pride

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - The universal bible for Flexbox.
